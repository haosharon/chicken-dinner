Single Player Blackjack

This program runs a simple player vs dealer blackjack game. The command to run the program is:
python Blackjack.py

The default starting balance for the player is $500. This can be specified with an addition argument.
For example, to specifiy a starting balance of $6000, one can run:
python Blackjack.py 6000

All code for this program can be found in Blackjack.py. The code uses the random and sys python libraries.

I'm not 100% clear on all the nitty gritty rules of Blackjack, but I think I got the gist of it. As
requested, the dealer must hit on soft 17, and splitting is not allowed.
